                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci (born April 15, 1452, Anchiano, near Vinci, Republic of Florence [Italy]—died May 2, 1519, Cloux [now Clos-Lucé], France) was an Italian painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose skill and intelligence, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His Last Supper (1495–98) and Mona Lisa (c. 1503–19) are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time.</p>

                <h2>Works</h2>
                <p>Leonardo’s parents were unmarried at the time of his birth. His father, Ser Piero, was a Florentine notary and landlord, and his mother, Caterina, was a young peasant woman who shortly thereafter married an artisan. Leonardo grew up on his father’s family’s estate, where he was treated as a “legitimate” son and received the usual elementary education of that day: reading, writing, and arithmetic. Leonardo did not seriously study Latin, the key language of traditional learning, until much later, when he acquired a working knowledge of it on his own. He also did not apply himself to higher mathematics—advanced geometry and arithmetic—until he was 30 years old, when he began to study it with diligent tenacity.

                    Leonardo’s artistic inclinations must have appeared early. When he was about 15, his father, who enjoyed a high reputation in the Florence community, apprenticed him to artist Andrea del Verrocchio. In Verrocchio’s renowned workshop Leonardo received a multifaceted training that included painting and sculpture as well as the technical-mechanical arts. He also worked in the next-door workshop of artist Antonio Pollaiuolo. In 1472 Leonardo was accepted into the painters’ guild of Florence, but he remained in his teacher’s workshop for five more years, after which time he worked independently in Florence until 1481. There are a great many superb extant pen and pencil drawings from this period, including many technical sketches—for example, pumps, military weapons, mechanical apparatus—that offer evidence of Leonardo’s interest in and knowledge of technical matters even at the outset of his career.</p>

                     <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                        <p>A citizen of the world
                            Leonardo da Vinci was truly a citizen of the world. In his life he traveled a lot and lived in many different countries. He was born in the village of Vinci, in the Florence countryside, on April 15, 1452. He moved to Florence at the age of 17 to become an apprentice in the workshop of Andrea Verrocchio, one of the most important painters and sculptors of the Renaissance.
                            
                            Leonardo lived in Florence, Tuscany, until 1482, when he moved to Milan, which was part of another nation at the time. Then he lived in Mantua and Venice, returned to Florence in 1501 and left again in 1508. He returned to Milan, then lived a few years in Rome, in the Vatican State, and finally moved to France, to the court of King Francis I.
                            
                            He died in France, on May 2, 1519, in the castle of Amboise. Actually, he was the first to imagine a Europe without borders.
                            
                            Illegitimate son
                            Leonardo was the illegitimate son of an important and well respected notary, Ser Piero da Vinci, and of a peasant woman named Caterina. For this reason he was not raised by his parents, but instead by his paternal grandfather in the village of Vinci, in the Florentine countryside.
                            
                            His father had many other children, Leonardo was the eldest of 16 step-brothers and sisters!</p>
